## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

### 5. Query Optimization
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:
- **Indexing**: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
- **Query Execution Plan**: Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review and refine query performance.

## 15 Practice Questions

### Easy Level
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
```sql
SELECT * FROM spotify 
where Stream > 1000000000;
```
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
```sql
SELECT
     album,artist
FROM spotify
ORDER BY 1;

SELECT 
     DISTINCT album
FROM spotify
ORDER BY 1;
```
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT 
     SUM(comments) as total_comments 
FROM spotify
where licensed = 'true';
```
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
```sql
SELECT * FROM spotify
WHERE album_type ='single';
```
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
```sql
SELECT 
   Artist, COUNT(Track) AS total_no_songs from spotify 
group by Artist; 
```

### Medium Level
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
```sql
SELECT 
     album, AVG(Danceability) as avg_danceability 
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY album
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
```sql
SELECT 
     Track,
	 MAX(Energy) AS max_energy
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY Track
ORDER BY max_energy DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT
     Track,
	 SUM(Views) AS total_views,
	 SUM(Likes) AS total_likes 
FROM spotify 
WHERE official_video ='true'
GROUP BY Track
ORDER BY total_views DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
```sql
SELECT 
     Album, 
	 Track,
	 SUM(Views) as total_views
FROM spotify
GROUP BY Album,Track
ORDER BY total_views DESC;
```
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
```sql
SELECT * FROM
(SELECT
     Track,
	 COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Youtube' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_youtube,
	 COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Spotify' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_spotify
FROM spotify
GROUP BY Track
) as t1
WHERE
    streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube
	AND
	streamed_on_youtube <> 0;
```
### Advanced Level
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
```sql
WITH track_views AS (
    SELECT 
        artist,
        track,
        SUM(views) AS total_view
    FROM spotify
    GROUP BY artist, track
),
ranked_tracks AS (
    SELECT 
        artist,
        track,
        total_view,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY total_view DESC) AS rank
    FROM track_views
)
SELECT 
    artist,
    track,
    total_view,
    rank
FROM ranked_tracks
WHERE rank <= 3
ORDER BY artist, rank;
```
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
```sql
SELECT 
     track,
	 artist,
	 liveness
	 FROM  spotify
	 WHERE liveness > (SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);
```
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql

WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
   
4. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
```sql
SELECT
    artist,
    track,
    album,
    energy,
    liveness,
    (energy / NULLIF(liveness, 0)) AS energy_liveness_ratio
FROM
    spotify
WHERE
    (energy / NULLIF(liveness, 0)) > 1.2;
```
5. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
```sql
SELECT
    artist,
    track,
    views,
    likes,
    SUM(likes) OVER (ORDER BY views DESC) AS cumulative_likes
FROM
    spotify
ORDER BY
    views DESC;
```

## Query Optimization Technique 

To improve query performance, we carried out the following optimization process:

- **Initial Query Performance Analysis Using `EXPLAIN`**
    - We began by analyzing the performance of a query using the `EXPLAIN` function.
    - The query retrieved tracks based on the `artist` column, and the performance metrics were as follows:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **11.667 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **1.318 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result before optimization:
      ![EXPLAIN Before Index](https://github.com/bhi112/spotify/blob/main/Before%20optimize.png)

- **Index Creation on the `artist` Column**
    - To optimize the query performance, we created an index on the `artist` column. This ensures faster retrieval of rows where the artist is queried.
    - **SQL command** for creating the index:
      ```sql
      CREATE INDEX artist_index ON spotify (artist);
      ```

- **Performance Analysis After Index Creation**
    - After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **0.182 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **2.290 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result after index creation:
      ![EXPLAIN After Index](https://github.com/bhi112/spotify/blob/main/After%20Optimize.png)


This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.
